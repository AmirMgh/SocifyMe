<h1>SocifyMe</h1>
<p>This mobile app was implemented/demoed at A Thinking Ape & Facebook Vancouver hackathon in March 2014. View <a href="https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/augment-your-reality-24-hour-hackathon-registration-10431529987">ATA-FB Reality Mining Hackathon</a>.</p>

<p>SocifyMe reads your GPS and calendar to find out what event you are attending and where. The backend server gets this data and used NLP in order to crawl social media (Twitter) websites and explore who's attending that event. Next, the app shows you a list of people who are in the same event and rank them based on their similarity to your profile.</p>
